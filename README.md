## TODO Application

This is a simple TODO application built using React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, and Axios. It allows users to manage a list of tasks, with features such as viewing, adding, editing, and deleting TODO items.

Note: Due to the use of a placeholder API, adding, editing, and deleting tasks will not update the task list in real-time. These actions will not persist after a page reload.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete tasks.

- Persist tasks via a backend API.

- View a list of all tasks with user-friendly navigation.

- Global state management using Redux Toolkit.

- Efficient API integration with Axios.

- Routing with React Router DOM.

- Node.js (v14 or above)
